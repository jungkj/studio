# Admin Essay Upload Changes

## Overview
Modified the essay upload functionality to remove Supabase login requirement for admin users. The admin panel now relies on the password-based authentication (mimi123) and uses either the Supabase service role key or regular client for database operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Admin Service (`src/utils/essayAdminService.ts`)
- New service that handles essay operations for admin users
- Uses service role key when available to bypass RLS policies
- Falls back to regular client if service role key is not configured
- Maintains session-based admin authentication

### 2. Updated EssayAdmin Component (`src/components/EssayAdmin.tsx`)
- Removed Supabase login dialog and authentication flow
- Removed auth status display
- Uses the new `essayAdminService` instead of `essayService`
- Simplified upload process - just click "Upload to DB" after admin authentication

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Added `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to `.env.example`
- This key is optional but recommended for bypassing RLS policies

## How It Works

1. **Admin Authentication**: User enters password "mimi123" in the settings modal
2. **Session Management**: Admin authentication is stored in localStorage
3. **Upload Process**: 
   - Click "Upload to DB" button in Essay Admin panel
   - Service attempts to use service role key for privileged access
   - Falls back to regular client if service role key not available
   - Essays are uploaded with a default admin user_id

## Setup Instructions

1. **Optional but Recommended**: Add your Supabase service role key to `.env.local`:
   ```
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ```
   You can find this in your Supabase dashboard under Settings > API

2. **Without Service Role Key**: The system will still work but may be subject to RLS policies

## Security Notes

- The service role key should NEVER be exposed to the client
- It's only used server-side in the admin service
- The admin password (mimi123) provides application-level security
- Consider changing the admin password in production

## Testing

1. Open the app and click the settings (gear) icon
2. Click "Admin Access" and enter password "mimi123"
3. Click "Manage Essays" in the admin panel
4. Create or edit essays locally
5. Click "Upload to DB" to sync with Supabase

The upload will work without requiring Supabase authentication!
