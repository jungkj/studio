# Spotify Integration Setup Guide

Your Spotify "Now Playing" feature is ready to use! Here's how to set it up:

## üö® **IMPORTANT: Spotify Requirements Updated** 

As of 2025, Spotify has changed their redirect URI requirements:
- ‚ùå **`localhost` is NO LONGER ALLOWED** 
- ‚úÖ **Must use `127.0.0.1`** for local development  
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS required** for production URLs

**The code has been updated to use `http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback` automatically.**

## üéµ Current Configuration

- **Client ID**: `76f5efc0956c4fa4867ddd8f89fc1c59`
- **Client Secret**: `9a585cef5d3943c8909416e28a9bb88e`
- **Redirect URI**: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback` (Updated for Spotify requirements)

## üîß Spotify App Settings

### For Production (Vercel)

1. **Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)**
2. **Find your app** (Client ID: 76f5efc0956c4fa4867ddd8f89fc1c59)
3. **Click "Edit Settings"**
4. **Add this EXACT Redirect URI**: `https://studio-andy.vercel.app/spotifycallback`
5. **Save changes**

### For Local Development

Spotify requires specific redirect URI formats:
- ‚úÖ **Use this**: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/spotifycallback`
- ‚ùå **Don't use**: `http://localhost:3000/spotifycallback` (no longer allowed)

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your Setup Method

**Method A: Using ngrok (Most Reliable)**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start your app
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start ngrok
ngrok http 8080
```

**Method B: Try localhost alternatives**
- Just start: `npm run dev` and try the alternative URLs in Spotify

### Step 2: Configure Spotify Dashboard

1. **Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)**
2. **Find your app** (Client ID: 76f5efc0956c4fa4867ddd8f89fc1c59)  
3. **Click "Edit Settings"**
4. **Add this EXACT Redirect URI**:
   - **For development**: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback`
   - **For ngrok**: `https://YOUR_NGROK_URL.ngrok.io/callback` (if using ngrok)
5. **Save changes**

### Step 3: Test the Connection

1. **Open your app** (localhost:8080 or your ngrok URL)
2. **Open browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
3. **Click the music icon** in the bottom system tray
4. **Check console logs** - you'll see the redirect URI being used
