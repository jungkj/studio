            I'm a recent Boston College grad (Class of 2024) who studied the trifecta: 
            Finance, Computer Science, and Information Systems. Sounds like I couldn't 
            make up my mind, right? Well... you're not wrong ðŸ˜…
          </p>
          
          <p className="break-words">
            Here's the thing: I genuinely love building things. Whether it's coding up 
            a retro website that makes you feel nostalgic for computers you've never 
            owned, or diving into financial models that actually make sense, I'm all about 
            creating stuff that matters.

              I built this entire site because I was tired of boring portfolio websites. 
              Everyone's got the same Webflow template, same stock photos, same energy. 
              Where's the personality? Where's the FUN?

          <p className="break-words">
            When I'm not coding or analyzing spreadsheets, you'll find me listening to music 
            (my Spotify Wrapped is... diverse), exploring new places, or probably explaining 
            to someone why the original Mac was revolutionary.

            This website? It's my digital playground. It's where I can be authentically me 
            while showing off the work I'm actually proud of. No corporate buzzwords, 
            no "synergistic solutions" - just real projects, real thoughts, and real vibes.
